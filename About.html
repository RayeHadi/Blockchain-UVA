        <h1>Our Founding</h1>
        <p>Our club was founded in October 2023 by UVA third years Raye Hadi, Arjun Rohlfing-Das, and Grayson Alto. Their ambtion was to build an organization on grounds to provide educational and investment opportunities in blockchain for UVA students. All three students realized the revolutionary power behind this technology and understood how high the opportunity cost of continuing to ignore this technology was. By raising awareness, UVA blockchain hopes to create an ecosystem that empowers students to get involved and understand this new asset class and the technology behind it.</p>
