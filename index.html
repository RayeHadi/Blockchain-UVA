                <h3>Why Blockchain?</h3>
                <p>Combined with a consensus mechanism and hard coded rules, blockchain can enable autonomous networks that direct behaviors through incentives. These networks prioritize digital sovereignty of the user and allow for new applications not previously possible. New developments created by this technology offer new learning and investment opportunities our club aims to capitalize on.</p>

            <div class="tab-col">
                <h3>Digital Assets</h3>
                <p>The backbone of cryptocurrency and an essential element of this technology, digital assets are critical to blockchain based networks. Blockchains have no authority outside their chain making their native token paramount to security. Tokens are vital for proper incentives, growth, and value accrual of every network. Through research we intend to identify promising networks and gain exposure through the network’s native digital asset (token).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-col">
                <h3>A Pervasive Technology</h3>
                <p>When implemented correctly blockchain can be a transformative technology. This transformative nature has the ability to shift power dynamics to structures that empower the individual. This provides alternatives to many of the inefficient bureaucratic systems we know today. Blockchain has the potential to affect entire economic systems and establish itself as the base of many global industries.</p>
